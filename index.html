        <h2>Sobre mi</h2>

        <p>
          Att first I intended to be an animator and went to design school fully
          motivated to become just that. One thing led to another and 2 years
          went by and I was a (almost) fully fledged freelance web designer
          without ever planning to become one.
        </p>

        <p>
          This fortunate turn of events has lead me to design websites for such
          people as 
          <a
            title="Ikea Iceland"
            href="http://www.ikea.is"
            rel="nofollow"
            target="_blank"
            >Ikea</a
          >,
          <a href="http://www.lifebutiken.se/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"
            >Life</a
          >,
          <a
            href="http://www.designtorget.se/designtorget/se/"
            rel="nofollow"
            target="_blank"
            >Designtorget,</a
          >
          <a title="Private Estate Life in Luxembourg" href="http://www.pel.lu"
            >Private Estate Life</a
          >
          &amp;
          <a href="http://www.ih.is/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"
            >Ingvar Helgason.</a
          >
          To work with people from all over the world is very rewarding. Sweden,
          Denmark, Iceland, Germany, India, USA and England are some of the
          countries I have worked with. Well not the country itself, but people
          living there.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have sucessfully been a freelance web designer now for a while and
          it has given me even more love for this work. I have worked with ad
          agencies, web developers, diaper makers, pension funds, furniture
          makers, businiess women &amp; men, friends &amp; family.
